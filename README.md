# conjecture
Given a and b, where a,b ∈ Z+, a < b, then a = 7 and b = 10 is the only case where a! = π[a..b].

## Usage
Runs indefinitely by default, with a starting `a` value of 1, and frequently prints the current `a`.
Provide the `--start` and `--end` options to control the inclusive start and end values of `a`, and
`--no-status` to disable printing the current value of `a`.
